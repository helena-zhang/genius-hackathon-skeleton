# DevCamp Genius Skeleton Client with Image Processing

This repository combines a DevCamp Genius self-learning feed with an image processing capability that can extract events, reminders, and todo items from images.

   ```bash
   brew install tesseract
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## DevCamp Genius Client Setup

Setting up your DevCamp Genius self-learning feed is a breeze! We've implemented all of the user interaction and event pass-throughs for you, all you need to do is specify the project ID and access token you created.

Make sure to follow [these prerequisite instructions](https://gamalon.github.io/genius-hackathon-documentation/) first.

### Setup

* Install Node
* `npm install`

### Run the client

* To run the local instance: `npm start`
* The configuration for your project can be set under `/dist/index.html`:
```
  const project_name = '######';  // Replace with your hackathon project identifier
  const access_token = '######';  // Replace with your hackathon access token
```
[Type definitions](https://github.com/gamalon/genius-hackathon-skeleton/blob/main/client/src/entities.js#L981-L1122) for the front-end configuration object

### Setting the styling

The styling can be set multiple ways. We can either modify the [AppVariables.scss](https://github.com/gamalon/genius-hackathon-skeleton/blob/main/client/src/AppVariables.scss) file directly to update the styling defaults, or we can use the settings object [`design.settings.global`](https://github.com/gamalon/genius-hackathon-skeleton/blob/main/client/src/entities.js#L1014) where you set the CSS string that will override the defaults defined in the AppVariables.css.

### Building the client bundle
To build the production bundle run: `npm run build:prod`, this will create a `facet-chat.js` in the `/dist` folder.
